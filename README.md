# Nutrition Facts for Starbucks Menu

_This project was created within the scope of Data Scientist Nanodegree of Udacity._

## The Purpose of Project

It will be explored implementing the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) process as part of the Write a Data Science Blog Post project requirements for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.

The data explored in this notebook was obtained from the "Nutrition facts for Starbucks Menu" [Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/starbucks-menu). The data contains information about the Starbucks Drinks Menu with ingredients.
You can find my Medium Blog Post in this [link](https://ufukcolak.medium.com/nutrition-facts-for-starbucks-menu-481b643df9b3) for the full report. The jupyter notebook for this project is located in folder 

## Research Questions

- Is there any relationship between Calories and Beverage Preparation Type?
- Are the average amount of Total Fat related with Starbucks Drink Category?
- Difference In Calories between Classic Espresso Drinks and Signature Espresso Drinks?
- Which beverages should not be drunk under specific circumstances such as high calories and total fat?

## Project Motivation

The motivation behind the project is to study and understand the best drinks in Starbucks in terms of health. To understand this, I try to relationship between variables and learn what better is. 

## Files in Repository

## Summary of the results

As a result of these analyses, I have reached some conclusions. The most important of these are; when the size increase, calories level also increases. People should avoid some Starbucks Drinks to be healthy and these are White Chocolate Mocha (Without Whipped Cream) and Caramel Macchiato. The most amount of Calories levels belongs to beverages preparation with Whole Mik.

These drinks are based on the most nutritious and low-calories. In this context, our suggestions are as follows:
- Caffe Latte with Nonfat Milk
- Caffe Mocha Latte
- Cold Brew Coffee
- Caffe Americano
